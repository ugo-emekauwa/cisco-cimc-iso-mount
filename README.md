# How-To: Automating a Cisco CIMC ISO Mount and Reboot

The processes for server OS refreshes, firmware updates, etc. can be sped up by automating the mount of a needed ISO. The sample Windows PowerShell script named automate_cisco_iso_mount.ps1 listed in this repository demonstrates how to automate and log the mounting of an ISO on a Cisco UCS C-Series rack server using the CIMC (Cisco Integrated Management Controller) and then restarting that server to boot to the mounted ISO.

## Requirements:
  1. Windows Powershell 3.0 or above.
  2. Cisco UCS PowerTool Suite, Release 2.x or above.
